PROBLEM STATEMENT 1:
        Input : a string of comma separated numbers. The numbers 5 and 8 are present in the list Assume that 8 always comes after 5.   
        Case 1: num1 = add all numbers which do not lie between 5 and 8 in the input.   
        Case 2 : num2= numbers formed by concatenating all numbers from 5 to 8 . 
        Output: sum of num1 and num2   
        Example: 1)3,2,6,5,1,4,8,9 
        Num1:3+2+6+9 =20 Num2:5148 
        O/p=5148+20 = 5168 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 2:
        A string which is a mixture of letter and integer and special char from which find the largest even number from the available digit after removing the        duplicates.   
        If an even number is not formed then return -1.  
        Ex : infosys@337 
        O/p : -1   
        Hello#81@21349 
        O/p :983412
